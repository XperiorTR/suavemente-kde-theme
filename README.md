# Suavemente

A theme for KDE Plasma based on [Suave by phob1an](https://www.opencode.net/phob1an/suave).
This theme uses the [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox?tab=readme-ov-file#palette) color scheme.

Icon pack is **not** a part of this theme (though I do recommend you to use it if you are using this theme), the icon pack used in the below picture is the [Gruvbox Plus Icon Pack by SylEleuth](https://github.com/SylEleuth/gruvbox-plus-icon-pack))

Not yet finished, I am developing it regularly though.

This is my first public development project, It's also the second ever time I'm using Git for a project. (It's also the first time I've used Inkscape, I didn't have any vector design or graphic design experience going into this, again I'm very new to this stuff.)
I'm still learning how this stuff works...

This readme will probably change when everything is at a point where it is good enough but for now you have to feast your eyes upon unprofessional unprofessional-ness. :)

also sorry for the goofy commit messages lol
