Suavemente

A theme for KDE Plasma based on Suave by phob1an.
This theme uses the Gruvbox color scheme.

Not yet finished, I am developing it regularly though.

This is my first public development project, It's also the second ever time I'm using Git for a project. (It's also the first time I've used Inkscape, I didn't have any vector design or graphic design experience going into this, again I'm very new to this stuff.)
I'm still learning how this stuff works...

This readme will probably change when everything is at a point where it is good enough but for now you have to feast your eyes upon unprofessional unprofessional-ness. :)

also sorry for the goofy commit messages lol
